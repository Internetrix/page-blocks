This is a simple template for the TextBlock. It just outputs the Content.

Don't modify this file for customization. Instead copy it to your theme/templates folder or
to your templates folder within your project (eg. mysite/templates). If you intend to 
override all block templates, feel free to copy the whole "Blocks" folder from the module into
your template or project folder and then modify there.
