# Page-Blocks for SilverStripe

**IMPORTANT:** This module is currently work-in-progress and is subject to major changes or refactoring. Here's the current [TODO](TODO.md).

Please feel free to create pull-requests (especially for things in the TODO) or open issues with new ideas/requests.

## What is this?
Page-Blocks is a Module that adds content to a SilverStripe page in a modular way. Ever had a client that wanted some text, followed by a gallery, some more text and then a video?

You can do some of these things by allowing the user to insert videos and images directly into the content-editor (TinyMCE), but you'll lose control over the website-design.

The goal of this module is to allow flexible page-designs, while giving you full control over the design of the content. It's also great for single-page websites.

This module should be light-weight and extensible. We provide the backend integration, while **you** have to care about the frontend (we won't ship another gallery module). This isn't a all-round carefree package, but we provide some basic templates and (hopefully) a good documentation. 

## Requirements

#### Mandatory
 - [SilverStripe 3.1](http://www.silverstripe.org/stable-download/)
 - [GridField Bulk Editing Tools](https://github.com/colymba/GridFieldBulkEditingTools)
 - [GridField Extensions](https://github.com/ajshort/silverstripe-gridfieldextensions)

#### Optional (for a better experience)

 - [SortableGridField](https://github.com/UndefinedOffset/SortableGridField) (allow content-block sorting)
 - [sortablefile](https://github.com/bummzack/sortablefile) (attach many images and sort them with drag'n'drop)
 - [Better Buttons for GridField](https://github.com/unclecheese/silverstripe-gridfield-betterbuttons) (better buttons in your gridfield records)

## Installation

Use composer to install the module and all its dependencies.

    composer require "bummzack/page-blocks" "dev-master"
    
If you don't use composer, make sure you install at least the modules that are listed as "mandatory" under **Requirements**

After installing, make sure you rebuild the database and flush the cache (`dev/build?flush=1`).

**Important:** Your CMS won't change at all after the installation. You first have to configure the module. Read on.

## Configuration

The most important step is to add the `PageBlocks` extension to your page-types. It's up to you to decide which page-type should have blocks. For example you could create a custom Page named `BlockPage`. Here's a complete class listing for such a page:

```php
<?php
class BlockPage extends Page
{
    private static $description = 'A page with several content-blocks';
    
    private static $extensions = array(
        'PageBlocks'
    );
}

class ContentPage_Controller extends Page_Controller
{
    
}
```

Yep, that's it. Now you can create a new `BlockPage` in the CMS and add content-blocks to it. Of course you can also apply the extension via `config.yml` (even to existing page-types). Here's how you would add blocks to your `Page` class:

```yml
# put this in your mysite/_config/config.yml
Page:
  extensions:
    - PageBlocks
```

#### Overriding some of the defaults

To disable the "Publish Page & Blocks" Button in the CMS:
```yml
PageBlocks:
  allow_publish_all: false
```

To customize the video-block aspect-ratios and player appearance. In this example we configure several aspect-ratios to choose from and set the player controls to red (only works with the vimeo player).

```yml
VideoBlock:
  player_color: 'ff0000'
  aspect_ratios:
    - '0' # Automatic
    - '21/9' # Cinemascope
    - '16/9'
    - '8/5'
    - '4/3'
```

## Templates
There are example templates for all the blocks available in the `page-blocks/templates/Blocks` directory. Feel free to copy the entirey `Blocks` directory to your `themes/<themename>/templates` or into your `mysite/templates` folder so that you can customize them to your liking.

To output your blocks in your page templates, do something like this:
```html
<% loop $Blocks %>
<section class="block $ClassName">
	<h2>$Title</h2> <!-- The block title is being used as section header -->
	$HTML <!-- This will be rendered with the specific block template -->
</section>
<% end_loop %>
```

There's also an include file you can use to output all the blocks. It can be found at `page-blocks/templates/Includes/Blocks.ss`.

## Writing custom Blocks

Writing your custom Blocks is super easy (just subclass `Block`). Let's assume you want to create some sort of "Embed-Block" that allows you to embed external content via iframe or similar:

```php
<?php
class EmbedBlock extends Block
{
    private static $db = array(
        'EmbedCode' => 'Text'
    );
    
    public function getCMSFields()
    {
        $fields = parent::getCMSFields();
        $fields->addFieldToTab('Root.Main', 
            new TextareaField('EmbedCode', 'Embed code'));
        $this->extend('updateCMSFields', $fields); // be nice to extensions
        return $fields;
    }
}
```

Then also create a matching template (named `EmbedBlock.ss`) in your template folder. The template code could look like this:
```yml
<%-- Well, this template is rather simple --%>
$EmbedCode.RAW
```

Then just run `dev/build?flush=1` and you're set. The EmbedBlock should be available in the cms via dropdown.
